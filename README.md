# DemonHacks Hackathon Hosted @ DePaul University on October 19 - 20, 2019
Participants: Shin Imai, Michael J Hoang, Tommy Bart, Maria Garcia, Arturo Granados
Theme: Public Transportation
Idea: Creating a new version of Chicago Transport Authority's Ventra App to include an improved interactive map of train locations, as well as time tables to include arrival time and time remaining. This app also includes a new feature to help report suspicious activity, where the user can send a photo to the authorites.
